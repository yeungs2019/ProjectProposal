# ProjectProposal
Four-part Writing Machine

Name: Steven Yeung
Project Advisor: Dr. Sean Hayes
Expected Graduation Date: May 2022

Problem Statement
Learning music theory and its rules are not at the speed as it should be.  Many places for learning music theory are at a slow pace.  It usually takes more than 2 months of time to have the theory rules completely secured.  The problem is with the four-part writing rules.  Many people have the difficulty in learning the four-part learning rules at a fast pace.  Because many people have the trouble learning the rules quickly, it can slow down the instructor and cause him/her to slow down the pace, which is detrimental in covering all material effectively.  Also, the handful of students that have the rules secured are forced to stay behind and review the same material along with those who are having difficulty with the rules.  

	Machine will be coded using a user interface programming language like JavaScript or Java.  Logic will be applied to program according to the rules of four-part writing.  Rules will include denial of parallel fifths, parallel octaves, and illegal doubling of notes, etc.  With the creation of this program will allow not only the student to learn faster but may be developed further to allow music professors to use as an auto grader.  This will save time in the professors’ hands because they will not have to manually go through every assignment and can simply enter the assignment through the machine.  (This may apply to the project depending on time constraints).  Struggling students will have a better time learning four-part writing with the machine because it can help them learn quicker and more efficiently.  

Project Description

Four-part writing has been an important aspect when studying music theory.  To learn this subject quickly, practice must be done tediously to achieve this skill.  With this project, results will be delivered immediately without the wait of another person(s) approval.  This project will feature the aspects of computer science alongside with aspects of music writing to allow creativity to take place.  The purpose of the project is to enhance the number of musical tools, technically, that will allow musicians to use.  The aim of the project is to accelerate learning four-part harmonies as well as save time for the ones studying music.  

Proposed Languages

-	C++, JavaScript, QT

Libraries in Languages

-	Any standard library that is provided in C++.  These are not limited to vector, list, stack, queue, tree, etc.

Additional Software

This project will be pulled from an open-source repository.  MuseScore is an open-source music notation software that will be used to accomplish the four-part writing machine.  It will be implemented using C++ and as an additional plugin for the project.

Personal Motivation

I feel like this project can help me understand programming on another level because I am trying to create something that also interests me.  It will also help me understand data structures that can potentially be used in this project.  

How will the project be completed?

The project will be completed using the above languages mentioned.  If a change is necessary, it will be carried over.  Deliverables may include designing the interface, proposing logic that is correct, etc.
