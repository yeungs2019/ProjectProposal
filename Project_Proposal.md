# Problem Statement
   Four-part harmony and its rules are usually difficult concepts to master and require a lot of practice and time.  Some people (musicians) do not have the time to sit and figure out the rules and memorize them.
   
   Learning music theory and its rules are not at the speed as it should be.  Many places for learning music theory are at a slow pace.  It usually takes more than 2 months of time to have the theory rules completely secured.  The problem is with the four-part writing rules.  Many people have the difficulty in learning the four-part learning rules at a fast pace.  Because many people have the trouble learning the rules quickly, it can slow down the instructor and cause him/her to slow down the pace, which is detrimental in covering all material effectively.  Also, the handful of students that have the rules secured are forced to stay behind and review the same material along with those who are having difficulty with the rules.  

   Machine will be coded using a user interface programming language like JavaScript or Java.  Logic will be applied to program according to the rules of four-part writing.  Rules will include denial of parallel fifths, parallel octaves, and illegal doubling of notes, etc.  With the creation of this program will allow not only the student to learn faster but may be developed further to allow music professors to use as an auto grader.  This will save time in the professors’ hands because they will not have to manually go through every assignment and can simply enter the assignment through the machine.  (This may apply to the project depending on time constraints).  Struggling students will have a better time learning four-part writing with the machine because it can help them learn quicker and more efficiently.  

# Project Description

Four-part writing has been an important aspect when studying music theory.  To learn this subject quickly, practice must be done tediously to achieve this skill.  With this project, results will be delivered immediately without the wait of another person(s) approval.  This project will feature the aspects of computer science alongside with aspects of music writing to allow creativity to take place.  When the user opens this project, they will be met with a blank grand staff.  The user will be able to create their own four-part harmony using an extension of an open source note notation software.  This will be accomplished by them dragging and dropping notes on a staff and creating chords, which is four notes in one beat.  They are vertical. (think of church hymnal books). They are also able to write roman numerals.  This will be their roman numeral analysis. Once they have completed their melody and roman numeral analysis, they will hit run and the project will point out their errors and prompt them to correct them.

# Proposed Languages

-	C++, JavaScript, QT

# Libraries in Languages

-	Any standard library that is provided in C++.  These are not limited to vector, list, stack, queue, tree, etc.

# Additional Software

This project will be pulled from an open-source repository.  MuseScore is an open-source music notation software that will be used to accomplish the four-part writing machine.  It will be implemented using C++ and as an additional plugin for the project.

# Personal Motivation

I feel like this project can help me understand programming on another level because I am trying to create something that also interests me.  It will also help me understand data structures that can potentially be used in this project.  I am also a musician myself.  I also understand the struggles of learning four-part harmony for the first time.  It was not an easy feat.  With this project in the making, it can potentially help solve most of the musician's problems when it comes to learning four-part harmony and its rules.

# How will the project be completed?
Research will be conducted by looking up open-source software like MuseScore to obtain ideas on how the software will function as a whole.  It is not only the programming language that is present, but other extenstions like QT and JavaScript.  Logic will be mapped out and rules of the harmony will be applied to the logic.  Data structure research may also be conducted because the notes need to be stored in memory somehow.  This applies to the roman numerals as well.  Research on a vector traversing through notes on a staff as it is running may be a possibility.  Overall, the majority of research will be done by studying the open source code really well and seeing how the developers coded it.  The project will be completed using the above languages mentioned. The majority of the project will coded in C++ on visual studio and using other extensions to execute the project.  Testing will done throughout the coding process to ensure that every corner case is not missing.  Deliverables may include designing the interface, proposing logic that is correct, configuring the program altogether etc.
