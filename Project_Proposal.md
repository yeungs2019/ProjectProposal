# Problem Statement
   Music students learning how to four-part write melodies easily and understanding how the rules work by using the project as a learning tool is the quickest and fastest way to learn the rules of four-part harmony.  If all logic goes well in the project, students will not have an issue learning and understanding the rules of four-part running.  Music theory is a difficult concept to understand, but with the creation of this project, the process of learning music theory will be more feasible.
   
   Learning music theory and its rules are not at the speed as it should be.  Many places for learning music theory are at a slow pace.  It usually takes more than 2 months of time to have the theory rules completely secured.  The problem is with the four-part writing rules.  Many people have the difficulty in learning the four-part learning rules at a fast pace.  Because many people have the trouble learning the rules quickly, it can slow down the instructor and cause him/her to slow down the pace, which is detrimental in covering all material effectively.  Also, the handful of students that have the rules secured are forced to stay behind and review the same material along with those who are having difficulty with the rules.  

   The logic will be coded using a user programming language like JavaScript or Java or C++ and other extensions like QT.  Logic will be applied to program according to the rules of four-part writing. The traditional way of teaching these rules are not as efficient because it requires another person to be present to correct the learner.  With the creation of this program will allow the student to learn faster without another person(s) present. They may receive instant feedback on what is wrong with their melody, without telling them the answer, but will tell them exactly what is wrong.  Struggling students will have a better time learning four-part writing with the machine because it can help them learn quicker and more efficiently.  

# Project Description

Four-part writing has been an important aspect when studying music theory.  To learn this subject quickly, practice must be done tediously to achieve this skill.  With this project, results will be delivered immediately without the wait of another person(s) approval.  This project will feature the aspects of computer science alongside with aspects of music writing to allow creativity to take place.  When the user opens this project, they will be met with a blank grand staff.  The user will be able to create their own four-part harmony using an extension of an open source note notation software.  This will be accomplished by them dragging and dropping notes on a staff and creating chords, which is four notes in one beat.  They are vertical. (think of church hymnal books). They are also able to write roman numerals.  This will be their roman numeral analysis. Once they have completed their melody and roman numeral analysis, they will hit run and the project will point out their errors and prompt them to correct them. Rules will include denial of parallel fifths, parallel octaves, illegal doubling of notes, incorrect roman numeral leading, etc. 

# Proposed Languages

-	C++, JavaScript, QT

# Libraries in Languages

-	Any standard library that is provided in C++.  These are not limited to vector, list, stack, queue, tree, etc.

# Additional Software

This project will be pulled from an open-source repository.  MuseScore is an open-source music notation software that will be used to accomplish the four-part writing machine.  It will be implemented using C++ and as an additional plugin for the project.

# Personal Motivation

I feel like this project can help me understand programming on another level because I am trying to create something that also interests me.  It will also help me understand data structures that can potentially be used in this project.  I am also a musician myself.  I also understand the struggles of learning four-part harmony for the first time.  Not only with coding, I also enjoy creating small compositions.  Four-part harmony writing is the foundation.  If four-part harmony is understood really well, then composition will be not as demanding.  With this project in the making, it can potentially help solve most of the musician's problems when it comes to learning four-part harmony and its rules.  When first introduced to four-part harmony, making it sound ok was only about five percent.  The main bulk came from understanding the rules and functions of chords.  With this project, it can help guide other musicians that are learning this for the first time to understand the rules better because they can see their errors rather than guessing.

# Outline of Future Research Efforts
Research will be conducted by looking up open-source software like MuseScore to obtain ideas on how the software will function as a whole.  It is not only the programming language that is present, but other extenstions like QT and JavaScript.  Since a GUI framework like QT is unknown, as well as JavaScript, it will be a learning experience. Tutorials on how to utilize QT and JavaScript will be a challenge.  Time will be spent researching on how those other frameworks/programming languages outside of C++.  QT is a GUI framework that is used to run the project.  JavaScript is a backbone for the project, as it will be how some of the project will be structured.  Logic will be mapped out and rules of the harmony will be applied to the logic.  Data structure research may also be conducted because the notes need to be stored in memory somehow.  This applies to the roman numerals as well.  Research on a vector traversing through notes on a staff as it is running may be a possibility.  Overall, the majority of research will be done by studying the open source code really well and seeing how the developers coded it.  The project will be completed using the above languages mentioned. The majority of the project will coded in C++ on visual studio and using other extensions to execute the project.  Testing will done throughout the coding process to ensure that every corner case is not missing.  Deliverables may include designing the interface, proposing logic that is correct, configuring the program altogether etc. Another part of research is to review the various rules of four-part harmony.  The rules are, but not limited to parallel fifths, octaves, leading tone note leading to a note besides tonic.  Some roman numerals are not allowed to lead to one another.  The logic there will be included in the research design.  Overall, understanding four-part harmony and its theory is a necessity when completing this project.
